# **Apache OFBiz Assignment**

## **Overview**
This project involves setting up and working with **Apache OFBiz**, an open-source enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The goal is to explore OFBiz by creating a custom component, defining entities, writing services, and developing UI elements.

## **Project Setup**

### **1. Setup and Run Apache OFBiz**
- Downloaded and installed **Apache OFBiz**.
- Started OFBiz using the command:
  ```sh
  ./gradlew ofbiz 
  ```
- Verified the setup by accessing the OFBiz web interface at `http://localhost:8443/webtools/control/main`.

### **2. Created a Custom Component**
- Used the following command to generate a new component named **ofbizdemo**:
  ```sh
  ./gradlew createPlugin -PpluginId=ofbizdemo  
  ```
- This created a directory structure for the **ofbizdemo** component.

## **Entity Creation and Data Management**

### **3. Defined Entities**
Created two entities:
- **OfbizDemoType**
- **OfbizDemo**

Entities were defined in the `entitymodel.xml` file within the `ofbizdemo` component under the entitydef directory.

### **4. Loaded Sample Data**
Prepared XML data files to populate the entities. Data was loaded using:
  ```sh
  ./gradlew loadAll"  
  ```

## **Service Development**

### **5. Created a Service**
Developed a service named **createOfbizDemo** that performs business logic for managing demo data. The service was implemented in:
- **Java** (`OfbizDemoServices.java`)
- **Groovy** (`OfbizDemoServices.groovy`)
 

- Created the service in `services.xml` and tested it using the **OFBiz Service Engine** in **Run Service**.

### **6. Created an Event**
Implemented an event named **createOfbizDemoEvent** to handle user actions and trigger the service. Registered it in the `controller.xml` file.

## **User Interface Development**

### **7. Created UI Forms**
Developed forms to interact with the **OfbizDemo** entity:
- **Add Form**: `AddOfbizDemo` – Allows users to add new records.
- **Find Form**: `FindOfbizDemo` – Enables users to search and filter records.

### **8. Built Screens and Menus**
- Created screens using **FREEMARKER (.ftl)** templates.
- Added menu options for navigating to the forms and services.

## **Customization and Enhancements**

### **9. Created a Custom Decorator**
Designed a custom **decorator** to enhance the user interface. This modified the **default layout and styling** of OFBiz screens.

## **Key Learnings**
✅ **Component Creation**: Understanding how to create and register custom components.  
✅ **Entity Management**: Defining entities and loading data into them.  
✅ **Service Development**: Implementing services in both Java and Groovy.  
✅ **Event Handling**: Triggering services using events in `controller.xml`.  
✅ **User Interface Development**: Building screens, menus, and forms for user interactions.  
✅ **Customization**: Modifying default OFBiz layouts using decorators.
